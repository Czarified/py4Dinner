# py4Dinner


### Let them eat py!

Py4Dinner is a meal planning tool that allows you to quickly and easily figure you what to eat, and what to buy! It allows you to plan as many meals as you want, for as many days as you want, for as many people as you want, and pulls from a defined recipe book of information. After building your meal plan, it can generate a grocery list, daily nutrition information, and a menu. Stop spending hours each week figuring out what to cook and what ingredients you need, we have Python for that!


This project is still a heavy WIP. I'm also figuring out how to use github for the first time...
